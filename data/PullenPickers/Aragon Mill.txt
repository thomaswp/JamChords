Aragon Mill
Song #73

Key of G

At the [G] end of the town at the [Em] foot of the hill,
Stands a [D] chimney so tall that says [C] Aragon [G] Mill.
But there's [G] no smoke at all coming [Em] out of the stack,
For the [D] mill has shut down and it's [C] not coming [G] back.

Chorus:
And the [G] only tune I hear is the [Em] sound of the wind,
As it [D] blows through the town. Weave and [C] spin, weave and [G] spin.

Now I'm too old to work and I'm too young to die
And there's no place to go for my woman and I
There's no children at all in the narrow empty streets
All the looms have shut down its so quiet I can't sleep

Chorus:

For the mill has shut down, it's the only life I know
Tell me where will I go, tell me where I will go

Chorus:
