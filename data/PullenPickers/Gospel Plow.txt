Gospel Plow (Hold On)
African American Spiritual

Mary [Am] wore three lengths of chain,                
Ev'ry [Am] length was Jesus name,
Keep-a your [D] hand on that [E] plow, hold [Am]on

Hold on [Dm] hold on [Am]
Keep your [C] eye on that [Em] plow, [Am] and hold right on

Matthew, Mark and Luke and John,
All them prophets so good and gone,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on

Hold on, hold on
Keep your eye on that plow, hold on

*Break

I never been to heaven, but I've been told,
Streets up there are lined with gold,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on

Hold on, hold on
Keep your eye on that plow, hold on

Dig my grave with a bloody spade,
See that my digger gets well paid,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on

Hold on, hold on
Keep your eye on that plow, hold on

*Break 

That gospel line gets mighty hot,
But just hang on with all you got,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on

Hold on, hold on
Keep your eye on that plow, hold on

When I get to the glory land,
Gonna play in the glory land,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on

Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold right on
