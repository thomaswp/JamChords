Lifeâ€™s Railway to Heaven
Song #6
Charles Davis Tillman 
Jerry Lee Lewis
Leader(s):  Dane


[G] Life is like a mountain railway 
With an [C] Engineer that's [G] brave.
We must make the run successful 
From the [A7] cradle to the [D] grave.
Heed the [G] curves the hills the tunnels, 
Never [C] falter, never [G] fail.                                
Keep your hand upon the throttle, 
And your [D7] eye upon the [G] rail.

Chorus

Blessed [C] Savior, Thou wilt [G] guide us
Till we reach that blissful [A7] shore.
Where the [G] angels wait to join us 
In God's praise for [D7] ever [G] more.


As we roll along the mainline, 
There'll be storms and there'll be night. 
There'll be sidetracks unexpected 
On the left and on the right.
But with the straight always before us 
And our hearts upon the prize.
There'll be no disembarkation 
Until we reach paradise.

Chorus
