Long Black Veil
Song #17
Danny Dill and Marijohn Wilkin 
The Chieftains with Mick Jagger
Leader(s): Jim (E Capo up 3)

[G] Ten years ago on a cold dark night
There was [D7] someone killed ‘neath the [C] town hall [G] light
[G] There were few at the scene but they all agreed
That the [D7] slayer who ran looked a [C] lot like [G] me

[G] The judge said son what is your alibi
If you were [D7] somewhere else then [C] you won’t have to [G] die
[G] I spoke not a word though it meant my life
For I had [D7] been in the arms of my [C] best friend’s [G] wife

Chorus

She [C] walks these [G] hills in a [C] long black [G] veil
She [C] visits my [G] grave when the [C] night winds [G] wail
[G] Nobody knows [C] nobody [G] sees
[C] Nobody [D7] knows but [G] me

The [G] scaffold was high and eternity near
She [D7] stood in the crowd and [C] shed not a [G] tear
[G] But sometimes at night when the cold wind blows
In a [D7] long black veil she [C] cries o’er my [G] bones

Chorus

She [C] walks these [G] hills in a [C] long black [G] veil
She [C] visits my [G] grave when the [C] night winds [G] wail
[G] Nobody knows [C] nobody [G] sees
[C] Nobody [D7] knows but [G] me
[C] Nobody [D7] knows but [G] me
[C] Nobody [D7] knows but [G] me
