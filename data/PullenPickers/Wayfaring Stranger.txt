Wayfaring Stranger
Song #21
Traditional 
Riannon Giddens 
Leader(s):  Mark (in Em)

I am a [Em] poor way faring [Em] stranger 
A-trav'ling [Am] through this land of [Em - D] woe. 
And there's no [Em] sickness, [G] toil or [Em] danger 
In that bright [Dm-B7] land to which I [Em] go. 

I'm going [C] home to see my [G] father (mother, sister, brother etc.) 
I'm going [C] there no more to [Em-D] roam. 
I'm just a- [Em] going [G] over [Em] Jordan 
I'm just a- [Am-B7] going over [Em] home. 

I know dark clouds will gather 'round me 
I know my way is steep and rough. 
But beauteous fields lie just beyond me 
Where souls redeemed their vigil keep. 
I'm going there to meet my mother 
She said she'd meet me when I come 
I'm just a-going over Jordan, I'm just a-going over home. 

1I want to wear a crown of glory 
When I get home to that bright land 
I want to shout Salvation's story 
In concert with that blood-washed band. 
I'm going there to meet my Savior 
To sing God’s praises evermore 
I'm only going over Jordan 
I'm only going over home. 

I’ll soon be free from every trial
This form shall rest beneath the sod
I’ll drop the cross of self-denial
And enter in that home with God.
I’m going home to see my Savior.
I’m going home no more to roam.
I’m just a-going over Jordan.
I’m just a-going over home.
