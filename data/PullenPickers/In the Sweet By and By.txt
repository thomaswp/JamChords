There's a [G] land that is [G] fairer than [G] day,And by [G] faith we can see it a [E7] far;For the [G] Father waits [G] over the [G] wayTo pre [G] pare us a [E] dwelling place [G] there.

In the [G] sweet by and [E] by,We shall [E] meet on that beautiful [G] shore;In the [G] sweet by and [E] by,We shall [G] meet on that [E] beautiful [G] shore.
CHORUS
We shall [G] sing on that [G] beautiful [G] shoreThe me [G] lodious songs of the [E7] blessed;And our [G] spirits shall [G] sorrow no [G] more,Not a [G] sigh for the [E] blessing of [G] rest.
CHORUS
To our [G] bountiful [G] Father [G] above,We will [G] offer our tribute of [E7] praiseFor the [G] glorious [G] gift of His [G] loveAnd the [G] blessings that [E] hallow our [G] days.
