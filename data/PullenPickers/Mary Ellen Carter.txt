The Mary Ellen Carter
Stan Rodgers

[Verse 1]
She went [G] down last October in a [C] pouring driving [G] rain.
The [Am] skipper, he’d been drinking and the [C] Mate, he felt no [D] pain.
Too [G] close to Three Mile Rock, and she was [C] dealt her mortal [G] blow,
And the [Am] Mary Ellen Carter settled [D] low.

There were [G] just us five aboard her when she [C] finally was a-[G]-wash.
We’d [Am] worked like hell to save her, all [C] heedless of the [D] cost.
And the [G] groan she gave as she went down, it [C] caused us to [G] proclaim
That the [Am] Mary Ellen [D] Carter would rise [G] again.

[Verse 2]
Well, the owners wrote her off; not a nickel would they spend.
“She gave twenty years of service, boys, then met her sorry end.
But insurance paid the loss to us, so let her rest below.”
Then they laughed at us and said we had to go.

But we talked of her all winter, some days around the clock,
She’s worth a quarter million, afloat and at the dock.
And with every jar that hit the bar, we swore we would remain
And make the Mary Ellen Carter rise again.

[Chorus]
Rise [Am] again, [D]* rise [G] again,
That her [C] name not be lost to the [G] knowledge of [D] men.
To [G] those who loved her best and were [C] with her [D]* till the [G] end
Will make the [Am] Mary Ellen [D] Carter rise [G] again.
* Offbeat chord; can be skipped for simplicity.

[Verse 3]
All spring, now, we’ve been with her on a barge lent by a friend.
Three dives a day in hard hat suit and twice I’ve had the bends.
Thank God it’s only sixty feet and the currents here are slow
Or I’d never have the strength to go below.

But we’ve patched her rents, stopped her vents, dogged hatch and porthole down.
Put cables to her, ‘fore and aft and girded her around.
Tomorrow, noon, we hit the air and then take up the strain.
And make the Mary Ellen Carter Rise Again.

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
For we couldn’t leave her there, you see, to crumble into scale.
She’d saved our lives so many times, living through the gale
And the laughing, drunken rats who left her to a sorry grave
They won’t be laughing in another day...

And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow
With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go
Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain
And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again.

[Chorus]
Rise again, rise again – though your heart it be broken
And life about to end
No matter what you’ve lost, be it a home, a love, a friend.
Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again.

[Repeat Chorus]
