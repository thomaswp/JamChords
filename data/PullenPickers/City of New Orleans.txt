City of New Orleans
Song #24

Leader(s):  Jim

[C] Riding on the [G7] City of New [C] Orleans,
[Am] Illinois Central, [F] Monday morning [C] rail,
[C] Fifteen cars and [G7] fifteen restless [C] riders,
Three con [Am] ductors, [G7] twenty-five sacks of [C] mail.
All [Am] along the southbound odyssey, the [Em] train pulls out of Kankakee,
And [G7] rolls along past houses, farms and [D] fields.
[Am] Passing trains that have no name, and [Em] freight yards full of old gray men,
And [G7] graveyards of the [F] rusted automo [C] biles.

CHORUS:  	[F] Good morninâ€™ Am [G7] erica, how [C] are you?
Say [Am] don't you know me, [F] I'm your native [C] son. [G7]
I'm the [C] train they call the [G7] City of New [Am] Orleans,
I'll be [Bb] gone five [F] hundred miles [G7] when the day is [C] done.

Dealing card games with the old men in the club cars,
A penny a point, ain't no one keeping score.
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle, 
And feel the wheels rumbling 'neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman porters, and the sons of engineers,
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel.
Mothers with their babes asleep, rocking to the gentle beat,
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.

CHORUS

Nighttime on the City of New Orleans, changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Halfway home, and we'll be there by morning,
Through the Mississippi darkness, rolling down to the sea.
But all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream,
The steel rail still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his songs again, the passengers will please refrain,
This train's got the disappearin' railroad blues.

CHORUS:	Goodnight America, how are you?
Say don't you know me, I'm your native son.
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.
