Cuckoo Bird
Song #55
Jubal’s Kin (note the minor key) 
Rihanna Giddens and Friends
Leader(s): Thomas

[Am] Gonna build me a log cabin on a [G] mountain ever so [Am] high.
So I can see Willie as [G] she goes walking [Am] by.
[Am] The Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she [G] warbles as she [Am] flies.
[Am] She never says “Cuckoo” till the [G] fourth day of [Am] July.

[Am] I’ve played cards in England, I’ve [G] played cards in [Am] Spain.
[Am] I’ll bet you ten dollars, I’ll [G] beat you next [Am] game.

Instrumental Interlude

[Am] Jack o’ Diamonds, Jack o’ Diamonds, I [G] know you of [Am] old. 
[Am] You’ve robbed my pockets of my [G] silver and [Am] gold.

[Am] Our Horses ain’t hungry, they [G] won’t eat your [Am] hay.
I’ll [Am] drive up a little further, I’ll [G] feed them up a [Am] ways.

[Am] The Cuckoo is a pretty bird, she [G] warbles as she [Am] flies.
[Am] She never says “Cuckoo” till the [G] fourth day of [Am] July.
