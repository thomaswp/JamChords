Leader(s): Jim - Key of C, Changes to D

[C] Handful of habits, singing in Spanish, [A7] and mischief in [Dm] mind,
And [F] keepin' the beat with [G] humble feet, 
He's the [C] man in the [G] moon [C] shine.

[C] Row, row your boat, life is a show, [A7] without reason or [Dm] rhyme,
[F] what were you before, [C] before you were born, 
The [G] man in the moon [C] shine?

[C] Tolerant, de [C7] tached and a [F] mused. He's the [G] star of the bar, 
The dean of the scene, [G] your friend and mine.
He's the [G] man in the moon [C] shine.

[C] Roasts and toasts, and old dirty jokes, [A7] now it's closing [Dm] time.
but [F] no one's in charge, so [C] blow that ol' harp, 
For the [G] man in the moon [C] shine

(Key Change)
 
[D] One for the ditch, and one for the itch, [G] ol' Danny [B] boy be [Em] fine.
And the [G] perfect Manhattan for [D] Harry Dean Stanton, 
The [G] man in the moon [D] shine

[Am] Tolerant, [D] detached and [G] amused. He's the star of the bar, 
The [G] dean of the scene, [G] your friend and mine.
He's the [G] man in the moon [D] shine.

Yeah [G] strike up the band for that ol' repo [D] man,
The [G] man in the moon [D] shine

From [G] Paris to Texas, [D] Kentucky to the marquee,
The [G] man in the moon [D] shine.
