Key of D


CHORUS
[D] Go, tell it on the mountain,
[A7] Over the hills and [D] everywhere;
[D] Go, tell it on the mountain,
That [A7] Jesus Christ is [D] born.

[D] The shepherds feared [A7] and [D] trembled,
[A7] When low above the [D] earth,
Rang [D] out the an [A7] gels [D] chorus
That [G] hailed our Savior's [D-A7] birth.

CHORUS:

Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born
And God sent us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn.

CHORUS:
