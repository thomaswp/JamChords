This train done carried my mother, this train; This train done carried my mother, this train;
This train don carried my mother, my mother, my father, my sister and my brother;
This train done carried my mother, this train;

This train don't carry no gamblers, this train;  This train don't carry no gamblers, this train;
This train don't carry no gamblers,  No crap shooters, no midnight ramblers
This train is bound for glory, this train. 

This train don't carry no liars, this train; This train don't carry no liars, this train;
This train don't carry no liars, No hypocrites and no high flyers,
This train don't carry no liars, this train.

This train don't carry no jokers, this train; This train don't carry no jokers, this train
This train don't carry no jokers, No two-bit liars, no cigar smokers,
This train don't carry no smokers, this train.

This train don't carry no con men, this train; This train don't carry no con men, this train;
This train don't carry no con men, No wheeler dealers, no here and gone men,
This train don't carry no con men, this train.

This train don't carry no rustlers, this train; This train don't carry no rustlers, this train;
This train don't carry no rustlers, No side street walkers, no two bit hustlers,
This train is bound for glory, this train. 

This train don’t pay no transportation this train; This train don’t pay no transportation this train
This train don’t pay no transportation, No Jim Crow and no discrimination
This train is bound for glory this train

This train is the last train, this train; This train is the last train, this train;
This train is the last train, Get on board, she ain't coming back again,
This train is the last train, this train.
