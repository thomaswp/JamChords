Wagon Wheel
Song #25
Bob Dylan, Ketch Secor 
Old Crow Medicine Show
Leader(s):  Jim

[G] Headed down south to the [D] land of the Pine, 
[Em] Thumbin' my way into [C] North Caroline. 
[G] Staring up the road and [D] pray to God I see [Em] [C] head lights.
I [G] made it down the coast in [D] seventeen hours,
[Em] Pickin’ me a bouquet of [C] dogwood flowers and I'm
[G] Hopin’ for Raleigh I can [D] see my baby to [C] night.

Chorus	So [G] rock me mama like a [D] wagon wheel,
[Em] Rock me mama any [C] way you feel.
[G] Hey [D] mama [C] rock me.
[G] Rock me mama like the [D] wind and the rain.
[Em] Rock me mama like a [C] south bound train. 
[G] Hey [D] mama [G] rock me. 

Runnin' from the cold up in New England. 
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band. 
My baby plays the guitar, I pick the banjo now.
Old north country winters keep-a gettin' me low, 
An'I lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave 
But I ain't turning back to live that old life no more

Chorus

Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke. 
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke.
But he's a-headed west from the Cumberland Gap -- Johnson City, Tennessee. 
I gotta get a move on before for the sun. 
I hear my baby callin my name and I know that she's the only one, 
And if I die in Raleigh, at least I will die free.

Repeat Chorus
