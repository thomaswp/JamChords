[Am] Death came a-knockin' on my mother's door Singin' "Come on, mother, ain't ya ready to go?" And my mother stooped down, buckled up her shoes And she moved on down by the [E] Jordan stream. And then she shout "Hallelujah! Done, done my duty! Got on my travelin' shoes". 
[Am] Death came a-knockin' on my sister's door Singin' "Come on, sister, ain't ya ready to go?" And my sister stooped down, buckled up her shoes And she moved on down by the [E] Jordan stream. And then she shout [Am] "Hallelujah! Done, done my duty! Got on my travelin' shoes". Hey hey, Hey hey 
[Am] You know that death came a-knockin' on my brother's door Singin' "Come on, brother, ain't ya ready to go?" And my brother stooped down, buckled up his shoes And he moved on down by the [E] Jordan stream. And then he shout [Am] "Hallelujah! Done, done my duty!  Got on my travelin' shoes". 
[Am] You know when death came a-knockin' on my neighbor’s door Singin' "Come on, neighbor, ain't ya ready to go?" And my neighbor stooped down, buckled up his shoes And he moved on down by the [E] Jordan stream. And then he shout [Am] "Hallelujah! Done, done my duty! Got on my travelin' shoes". Hey hey, Hey hey 
[Am] You know that death came a-knockin' on my preacher’s door Singin' "Come on, preacher, ain't ya ready to go?" And my preacher stooped down, buckled up his shoes And he moved on down by the [E] Jordan stream. And then he shout [Am] "Hallelujah! Done, done my duty!  Got on my travelin' shoes". 
[Am] You know when death comes a-knockin' on my front door, Singin' "Come on, sister, ain't ya ready to go?" And then I'll stoop right down, buckle up my shoes And I'll move on down by the [E] Jordan stream. And then I'll shout [Am] "Hallelujah! Done, done my duty! Got on my travelin' shoes".
