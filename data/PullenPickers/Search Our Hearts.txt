Search Our Hearts
Song #81
Nancy Petty, Larry E. Schultz


Search our [C] hearts,
Know Our [Dm7] Thoughts
Our coming [C/E] in 
And going [F] out.
For we [C/G] long
To dwell with [G] you,
God of [C-F/G] grace.

Search our [C] hearts,
Know Our [Dm7] Thoughts
Our coming [C/E] in 
And going [F] out.
For we [C/G] long
To dwell with [G] you,
God of [C-F/G] grace.

Search our [C] hearts,
Know Our [Dm7] Thoughts
Our coming [C/E] in 
And going [F] out.
For we [C/G] long
To dwell with [G] you,
God of [C] grace.
