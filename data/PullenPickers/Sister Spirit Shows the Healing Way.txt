Sister Spirit Shows the Healing Way
Song #83
Jann Aldredge-Clanton, Charles A. Tindley, arr. B. B. McKinney
(Tune of “By and By”)
Bishop Carlton Pearson, Rick Betts Piano Tune and Lyrics



[D] When we cannot find our way [D7]
through the [G] long and gloomy [D] days,
we are [D] fearful and dis [Bm] couraged, heavy [E] hearted, and dis [A7] mayed.
Sister [D] Spirit comes to [D7] guide;
She is [G] always by our [E] side,
Clearly [D] showing us a [E] path that [A7] opens [D-G-D] wide.

Chorus:

[D] Sister Spirit [G] shows the healing [D] way,
[D] close beside us [E] evermore will [A7] stay.
[D] We will share Her story, [G] celebrate Her [D] power,
lifting [D] voices to re [E] claim this [A7] urgent [D] hour.

[D] When our labor seems in vain [D7]
and we [G] feel the stress and [D] strain,
We keep [D] working to dis [Bm] mantle systems [E] causing so much [A7] pain,
and no [D] matter how we [D7] try,
many [G] efforts go a [E] wry,
but we [D] know that Sister [E] Spirit [A7] hears our [D] cry.

Chorus:

Every [D] day around the world [D7]
hateful [C] messages are [D] hurled;
we will [D] overcome with [Bm] love and peaceful [E] banners now un [A7] furled.
Sister [D] Spirit takes down [D7] walls,
giving [C] courage when we [E] call;
we will [D] join Her [E] work of [A7] liberating [D] all.

Chorus:
