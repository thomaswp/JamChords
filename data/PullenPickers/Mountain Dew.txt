Mountain Dew
Song #4
Bascom Lamar Lunsford, Scotty Wiseman 
Foggy Mountain Boys
Leader(s):  Jim

[G] There's a big potted tree down an old hill from me,
Where you [C] lay down a dollar or [G] two.
You can go round the bend and when you come back again,
There's a jug full of [D7] good old mountain [G] dew.
 
Chorus

[G] Oh they call it that good old mountain dew,
and [C] them that refuse are [G] few.
I'll shut up my mug if you fill up my jug,
With some [D7] good old mountain [G] dew.
 
[G] My uncle Mort he is sawed off and short,
He [C] measures about four foot [G] two.
But he think he's a giant when you give him a pint
of that [D7] good old mountain [G] dew.
 
[G] My old aunt June bought some brand new perfume,
It [C] had such a sweet smellin' [G] pew.
But to her surprise when she had it analyzed
It's nothing but [D7] good old mountain [G] dew.
 
Chorus

[G] My brother Bill got a still on the hill,
Where he [C] runs off a gallon there or [G] two.
The buzzard in the sky get so drunk they can't fly,
From smelling that [D7] good old mountain [G] dew.
 
Chorus
