Jingle Bells
Song #31
James Lord Pierpont 
Bluegrass All-Stars Instrumental
Leader(s): 

[C] Dashing through the snow, In a one-horse open [F] sleigh,
O’er the fields we [G] go, [G7] Laughing all the [C] way (Ha, Ha, Ha)
Bells on bobtails ring, Making spirits [F] bright,
What fun it is to [G] ride and sing a [G7] sleighing song [C] tonight. [G7] Oh!

CHORUS

[C] Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
[F] Oh, what fun it [C] is to ride
In a [D] one-horse open [G] sleigh, [G7]  hey!
[C] Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way,
[F] Oh, what fun it [C] is to ride
In a [G] one-horse [G7] open [C] sleigh.

[C] A day or two ago I thought I’d take a [F] ride,
And soon Miss Fannie [G] Bright [G7] Was seated by my [C] Side (Ho, Ho, Ho)
[C] The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his [F] lot.
We [F] ran into a [G] drifted bank and there we got up [C] sot. [G7] Oh!

CHORUS

A [C] day or two ago, the story I must [F]  tell
I went out on the [F] snow and [G7] on my back I [C] fell.
A [C] gent was riding by in a one-horse open [F] sleigh
He [F] laughed at me as I [G] lay but [G7] quickly drove a [C] way.  [G7] Oh!

CHORUS

[C] Now the ground is white, go it while you're [F] young
[F] Take the girls a [G] long and [G7] sing this sleighing [C] song
Just [C] bet a bobtailed bay, two forty as his [F] speed
[F] Hitch him to an [G] open sleigh and [G7] crack! you'll take the[C]  lead. [G7] Oh!

CHORUS
