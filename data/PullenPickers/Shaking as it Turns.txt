Shaking as it Turns
Lula Wiles
Note: Verses are N.C. in the original. I've added chords.

[Verse 1]
Is this land [Bm] yours? Is this land [F#m] mine?
The fault lines [Em] crack and the fists they [F#m] fly
In the heat of the [Em] night, I touch the falling [Em] sky
It's a story as [Bm] old as the flag in the [F#m] yard
The money's too [Em] tight and the work's too [F#m] hard
Baby, do you [Em] know just who your enemies [Em] are?

[Chorus]
And the world, it [Bm] sings
And the world, it [Bm] burns
I feel the [Em] world shaking as it [F#m] turns
I feel the [Em] wor-[F#m]-ld (N.C.) shaking as it [Bm] turns

[Verse 2]
With eyes shut tight and the blood washed clean
The capital shines but it's a poison gleam
See the monuments fall, to God's great machine

[Chorus]
And the world, it sings
And the world, it burns
I feel the world shaking as it turns
I feel the world shaking as it turns

[Verse 3]
Judgment comes like a lightning strike
And the levees break and the oceans rise
And that little black train it could be here tonight
So don't talk about love if your love won't burn
If your love won't fight, if your love won't yearn
'Cause a love don't win, if it waits on some return

[Chorus]
And the world, it sings
And the world, it burns
I feel the world shaking as it turns
I feel the world shaking as it turns
