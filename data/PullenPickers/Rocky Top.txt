Rocky Top
Song #30
Boudleaux and Felice Bryant 
Charlie Daniels Band
Leader(s): 

[G] Wish that I was [C] on ol' [G] Rocky Top
[Em] Down in the [D] Tennessee [G] hills
Ain't no smoggy [C] smoke on [G] Rocky Top
[Em] Ain't no [D] telephone [G] bills
[G] Once I had a [C] girl on [G] Rocky Top
[Em] Half bear, [D] other half [G] cat
Wild as a mink and [C] sweet as [G] soda pop
[Em] I still [D] dream about [G] that

CHORUS

[Em] Rocky Top, you'll [D] always be [F] home sweet home to [C] me
Good ol' [G] Rocky Top
[G] Rocky Top, [F] Tenne [G] ssee, [G] Rocky Top, [F]Tenne [G] ssee

[G] Once two strangers [C] climbed ol' [G] Rocky Top
[Em] Lookin' for a [D] moonshine [G] still
Strangers ain't come [C] down from [G] Rocky Top
[Em] Reckon they [D] never [G] will
[G] Corn won't grow at [C] all on [G] Rocky Top
[Em] Ground's too [D] rocky by [G] far
That why all the [C] folks on [G] Rocky Top
[Em] Get their [D] corn from a [G] jar.

CHORUS

[G] I've had years of [C] cramped-up [G] city life
[Em] Trapped like a [D] duck in a [G] pen
All I know is it's a [C] pity [G] life
[Em] Can't be [D] simple a-[G] gain.

CHORUS

[G] Rocky Top, Tennessee [F] ee [C] ee [G ]ee.
