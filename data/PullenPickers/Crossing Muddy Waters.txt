Crossing Muddy Waters
Song #54
John Hiatt.   
Link (or the original by John Hiatt)
Leader(s): Thomas

[G] Baby’s gone and I don’t know [C] why. She [D] headed out this morn [Em] ing
Like a rusty shot in a hollow [C] sky. She [D] left me without warn [Em] ing

Sooner than the dogs could [C] bark, [D] faster than the sun [Em] rose.
Down to the banks in an old mule [C] cart she [D] took a flat boat, cross the shal [Em] lows

Chorus

Left me in my tears to drown, she left a baby daughter.
Now the river’s wide and deep and brown. She’s crossing muddy waters.

Tobacco standing in the fields, Be rotten come November.
And a bitter heart will not reveal a spring that love remembers.

When that sweet brown girl of mine, hair black as a raven.
We broke the bread and drank the wine from a jug that she’d been saving.

Chorus

Baby’s crying and the daylight’s gone. That big oak tree is groaning.
In a rush of wind and a river song I can hear my true love moaning.

Crying for her baby child, oh crying for her husband.
Crying for that rivers wild to take her from her loved ones 

Chorus
