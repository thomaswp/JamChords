Nine Pound Hammer
Song #40
Merle Travis 
Lonesome River Band
Leader(s): Dane in G


[G] This nine pound hammer
Is a little too [C7] heavy
Buddy for my [G] size size [D7]  size
Buddy for my [G] size
So I'm going on the [G] mountain
Just to see my [C7] baby
No I ain't coming [G] back
 
Chorus

Roll on [G] buddy
Don't you roll so [G7] slow
Well, tell me how can I [G] roll roll [D7] roll
When the wheels won't [G] go
Roll on [G] buddy
Pull you load of [C7] coal
Tell me how can I [G] pull [D7]
When the wheels won't [G] roll

 It's a long way to Harlan
It's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew (brew brew)
Just to get a little brew
And when I die
You can make my tombstone
Out of number nine coal
Out of number nine coal

Chorus
Chorus
Well, tell me how can I roll roll roll (Repeat 3 Times)
When the wheels won't go
