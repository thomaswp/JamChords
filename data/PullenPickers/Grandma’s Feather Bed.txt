Grandma’s Feather Bed
Song #89
Jim Conner
John Denver

Leader(s): Jim: Key of C

[C] When I was a [F] little bitty boy [C] just up off the [G7] floor, 
[C] We used to go down to [F] Grandma's house 
[C] Every month-[G7] end or [C] so. 
We'd have [C] chicken pie and [F] country ham 
'N’ [C] homemade butter on the [G7] bread. 
But the [C] best darn thing about [F] Grandma's house 
Was her [G7] great big feather [C] bed. 

Chorus 

It was [C] nine feet tall, and [C7] six feet wide, [F] soft as a downy [C] chick. 
It was [C] made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese 
Took a [D] whole bolt of cloth for the [G7] tick. 
It'd [C] hold eight kids and [C7] four hound dogs, 
And a [F] piggy that we stole from the [C] shed. 
We didn't [C] get much [C7] sleep, but we [F] had a lot of fun 
On [G7] Grandma's Feather [C] Bed. 

After supper, we'd sit around the fire, 
The old folks'd spit and chew. 
Pa would talk about the farm and the war 
And Granny'd sing a ballad or two. 
I'd sit and listen and watch the fire 
'Till the cobwebs filled my head, 
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the mornin' 
In the middle of the old feather bed. 

Chorus

Well, I love my Ma, I love my Pa, 
I love Granny and Grandpa too, 
I been fishing with my uncle, I rassled with my cousin, 
I even kissed Aunt Lou ooo! 
But if I ever had to make a choice, I guess it oughta be said 
That I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road 
For Grandma's feather bed.

Chorus
