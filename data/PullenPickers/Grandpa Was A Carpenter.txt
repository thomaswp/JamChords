Grandpa Was A Carpenter

Leader(s): Dane - Key of G (Recorded in Key of B)

Oh, [G] Grandpa wore his suit to dinner nearly every [C] day. 
No [G] particular reason, he just dressed that [D] way. 
[G] Brown necktie with a matching vest and both his wingtip [C] shoes. 
He built a [G] closet on our [D] back porch and put a penny in a burned-out [G[D]] fuse. 

CHORUS

[C] Grandpa was a carpenter, he built [G] houses, stores and banks. 
[C] Chain-smoked Camel [G] cigarettes and [D] hammered nails in planks. 
He was [G] level on the level, he [C] shaved even every door. 
And [G] voted for [D] Eisenhower, 'cause [G] Lincoln won the war.  
 
Well, he used to sing me "Blood on the Saddle" and rock me on his knee. 
And let me listen to the radio before we got TV. 
Well, he'd drive to church on Sunday and he'd take me with him too. 
Stained glass in every window, hearing aids in every pew. 

CHORUS

Well, my Grandma was a teacher, she went to school in Bowling Green. 
Traded in a milking cow for a Singer sewing machine. 
Well, she called her husband "Mister," and she walked real tall in pride. 
She used to buy me comic books after Grandpa died. 

CHORUS
