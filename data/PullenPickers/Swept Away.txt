Swept Away
Song #51
John Logan 
The Avett Brothers and Bonnie
Leader(s): Judy

Well [G] you send my life a [C] whirling
Darling when you're [G] twirling on the [D] floor.
And [G] who cares about to [C] morrow?
What more is [G] tomorrow? Than another [D] day?

CHORUS 

[Em] When you [G] swept me a [G] way, yeah you [G] swept me a [G] way
La la [G] la la la [G] la la la la la la [G] la la la la la

I [G] see the end of the [C] rainbow,
But what more is a [G] rainbow than colors out of [D] reach?
[G] If you come down to my [C] window
And I climb out my [G] window then we'll get out of [D] reach?

CHORUS (That…)

You said with such honest feeling
But what'd you really mean when you said that I'm your man?
Well how my darling can it be
When you have never seen me And you never will again?

CHORUS  (That…)

Well life is ever changing but I can always find a constant
And a comfort in your love 
With your heart my soul is bound
And as we dance I surely know that some kind of heaven will be found.
 
Well you send my life a whirling
Darling when you're twirling on the floor.
And who cares about tomorrow?
Girl, what more is tomorrow, than another day?
 
CHORUS 

When you swept me away, yeah you swept me away, yeah you swept me away.
