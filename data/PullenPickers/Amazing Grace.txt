Amazing Grace
Song #11
John Newton 
Soweto Gospel Choir
Leader(s): Mark Key of G


A [G] mazing grace how [C] sweet the [G] sound
that saved a wretch like [D7] me.
I [G] once was [G7] lost, but [C] now am [G] found,
was [Em] blind but [D7] now I [G] see.

`Twas [G] grace that taught my [G] heart to [G] fear,
and grace my fears re [D7]  lieved.
How [G] precious did that [C] grace [G] appear,
the [Em] hour I [D7] first be [G]  lieved.

Through [G] many dangers, [C] toils and [G] snares,
I have already [D7] come.
`Tis [G] grace hath brought me [G] safe thus [G] far,
and [Em] grace will [D7] lead me [G] home.

When [G] we’ve been there ten [C] thousand [G] years 
Bright shining as the [D7] sun
We’ve [G] no less [G7] days to [G] sing God’s [G] praise,
Than [Em] when we [D7] first be-[G]gun.

A [G] mazing grace how [C] sweet the [G] sound
that saved a wretch [D7] like me.
I [G] once was lost, but [C] now am [G] found,
was [Em] blind but [D7] now I [G] see.
I [G] once was lost, but [C] now am [G] found,
was [Em] blind but [D7] now I [G] see.
