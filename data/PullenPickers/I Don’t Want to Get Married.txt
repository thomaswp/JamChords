I Don’t Want to Get Married
Song #33
Allison de Groot, Tatiana Hargreaves 
Allison de Groot Tatiana Hargreaves
Leader(s): Noelle in C

[C] I was born in Kentucky, [G] Lived there all of my [C] life.[C] I was very lucky, [D] never had a [G7] wife.[C] I once thought I'd get married, I [F] asked a little girl to [C] wed.But [F] when I asked her to [C] marry me, [D] this is [G] what she [C] said.

CHORUS

[C] I don't wanna get married, [G] Always wanna be [C] free.[C] I don't love nobody, [D]  Ain’t nobody loves[G7] me.[C] All they want is my money, [F] They don't care for[C]  me.[C] I don't wanna get married, [D] I just [G7] wanna be [C] free.

Then I started to ramble, stopped in Tennessee.Met a pretty little maid, I thought she cared for me.I built a cute little cottage and planned a day to wed.But when I asked her to marry me, this is what she said.

I don't wanna get married, don't want to settle down.Ramble all over this country, go from town to town.I don't love nobody, ain't nobody loves me.
I don't want to get married. I just wanna be free.

Once again I traveled, this time headed West.I found the life of a bachelor, the one I love the best.I met a gal in Santa Fe who wanted me to wed.But when she asked me to marry her, his is what I said.
