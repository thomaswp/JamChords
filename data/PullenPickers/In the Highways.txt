Gillian Welch

Leader(s):  Noelle (in C)

In the [C] highways, [F] in the [C] hedges.
In the [F] highways, in the [G] hedges
In the [C] highways, [F] in the [C] hedges
I'll be [G7] somewhere working for my [C] Lord.

Chorus:
I'll be [F] somewhere working
I'll be [C] somewhere working
I'll be [G] somewhere working for my [C] Lord
I'll be [F] somewhere working
I'll be [C] somewhere working
I'll be [G] somewhere working for my [C] Lord.


If He calls me I will answer
If He calls me I will answer
If He calls me I will answer
I'll be somewhere working for my Lord.

Chorus

In the [C] highways, [F] in the [C] hedges.
In the [F] highways, in the [G] hedges
In the [C] highways, [F] in the [C] hedges
I'll be [G7] somewhere working for my [C] Lord.
