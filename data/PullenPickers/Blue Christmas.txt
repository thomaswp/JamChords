Blue Christmas
Song #27
Billy Hayes and Jay W. Johnson 
Elvis Presley Live with Martina McBride
Leader(s):  


I'll have a [D] blue Christmas  with [A] out you,
I'll be so blue just [A7] thinking  a [D] bout you. [D7]
Décor [D] ations of [D7] red on a [G] green Christmas [Em] tree,
[E7] Won't be the same dear, if [A] you're not here with [A7] me.
 
And when those [D] blue snowflakes start [A] fallin’
That’s when those blue [A7] memories start [D] callin’ [D7]
You’ll be [D] doin’  all [D7] right with your [G] Christmas of [E7] white
But [A] I’ll have a blue, blue, blue, blue [D] Christmas. [A]
 
[D] Mmm mm mm mm [D] Mmm mm mm mm
[A] Mmm mm mm mm [A] Mmm mm mm mm
[A7] Mmm mm mm mm [A7] Mmm mm mm mm
[D] Mmm mm mm mm mm mm
 
I'll have a [D] blue Christmas  that's [A] certain
And when that blue [A7] heartache starts [D] hurtin'
You‟ll be [D] doin’  all [D7] right with your [G] Christmas of [E7] white
But [A] I’ll have a blue, blue, blue, blue [D] Christmas. [A]
