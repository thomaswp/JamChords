Hallelujah
Song #26
Leonard Cohen 
Leonard Cohen Live In London
Leader(s):  Jim

Well I've [C] heard there was a [Am] secret chord,
That [C] David played and it [Am] pleased the Lord,
But [F] you don't really [G] care for music, [C] do [G] ya?
It [C] goes like this, the [F] 4th, the [G] 5th,
the [Am] minor fall and the [F] major lift,
The [G] baffled king com [E7] posing halle [Am] lujah,
 
CHORUS:  Halle- [F] lujah, halle [Am] lujah, halle [F] lujah, halle [C] lu [G] jah. [C]

Your [C] faith was strong but you [Am] needed proof,
You [C] saw her bathing [Am] on the roof,
Her [F] beauty and the [G] moonlight over- [C] threw [G] ya,
She [C] tied you to her [F] kitchen [G] chair,
She [Am] broke your throne and she [F] cut your hair,
And [G] from your lips she [E7] drew the halle [Am]  lujah,

CHORUS

I [C]  did my best, it  [Am]  wasn’t much,
I [C]  couldn’t feel so I  [Am]  tried to touch,
I’ve [F]  told the truth, I [G]  didn’t come to  [C]  fool [G]  ya.
And [C]  even though it [F]  all went [G] wrong,
I’ll [Am]  stand before the  [F]  Lord of Song,
With [G]  nothing on my  [E7]  tongue but  halle [Am]  lujah,

CHORUS
