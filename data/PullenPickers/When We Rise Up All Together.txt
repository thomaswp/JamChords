(Tune of “When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder, I’ll Be There”)
Statler Brothers, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Alison Kraus, Suzanne Cox--Blood Medley


We are [G] tired of ine [G7] quality, a [C] buse and violence, [G] too;
we re [G] fuse to sit in [A7] silence any [D7] more.
We will [G] raise our voices [G7] speaking out for [C] changes over [G] due;
we are [G] rising all to [D7] gether; hear us [G] roar.

Chorus:

When we [G] rise up all together;
when we [D7] rise up all together;
when we [G] rise up all toge [C] ther;
when we [G] rise up all to [D7] gether, we pre [G] vail.

In our [G] justice work we [G7] often feel dis [C] tressed and over [G] whelmed,
and it’s [G] hard to find the [A7] strength to carry [A7] on.
Then our [G] Mother Eagle [G7] takes us up to [C] glimpse a brighter [G] realm,
as we [G] rise with Her a [D7] gain to face the [G] dawn.

Chorus:

We will [G] soar with Mother [G7] Eagle as our [C] energy re [G] news; 
Her sup[G]  port and loving [A7] care will never [D7] cease.
She will [G] lift us up to [G7] gether to be [C] hold a glorious [G] view;
Now the [G] morning breaks with [D7] everlasting [G] peace.

Chorus:
