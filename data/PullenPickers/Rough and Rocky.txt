Rough and Rocky
Song #29
Charles Justice and Shoji Tabuchi 
Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs
Leader(s): 


[D] Darlin', I have [G] come to [D] you
Tho' it almost breaks my [A] heart
But [D] the [G] morning, [D] darlin'
[A] We'll be many miles a [D] part

CHORUS

[G] Don't that road look rough and [D] rocky
[D] Don't that sea look wide and [A] deep
[D] my baby  [G] look the [D] sweetest
[D] When he's in my arms a [D] sleep

Can't you hear the nightbird's cryin'
Far across the deep blue sea
While others you are thinking
Won't you sometimes think of me

CHORUS

One more kiss before I leave you
One more kiss before we part
You have caused me lots of trouble
Darlin', you have broke my heart

CHORUS
