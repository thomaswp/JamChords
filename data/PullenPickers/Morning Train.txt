Kickin’ Grass
Leader(s): Noelle, Key of C


CHORUS

[C] The Morning Train will carry me home
It’ll bring me [F] back where I be [C] long
And take my [F] soul to heaven’s [C] shore
Where I will see my [G] lord once [C] more

The morning [C] train, it makes me weep
For a life of [F] sin so long and [C] deep
Though I’m a [C] lone and surely [C] lost
I’ll keep my [G] eyes upon the [C] cross
 
CHORUS

The morning train it comes each day
To carry my fears and sins away
And all the nights can be so long
Come morning time my sins are gone
 
CHORUS
 
The morning train it calms my soul
I know I'm safe when the whistle blows
It carries far it carries wide
 
CHORUS+
Where I will see my lord once more
Where I will see my lord once more
