Jann Aldredge-Clanton, Lewis E. Jones
(Tune of “Power In The Blood”)
Sons of the Pioneers with Roy Rogers, Lari White


[G] Wisdom within us is [C] boundless and [G] free;
there’s [D] power in us all, [G] power in us all;
[G] She moves us forward to [C] all we can [G] be;
There’s [C] lifegiving [D7] power in us [G] all.

Chorus:

There is [G] power, power, [C] claim their wondrous [G] power
In us [D7] all, Every [G] where.
Claim their [G] power, power, [C] claim their wondrous [G] power
As we [D7] join to dream and to [G-C-G] dare.

[G] Though we are weary from [C] laboring [G] long,
there’s [D] power in us all, [G] power in us all;
[G] Wisdom will help us to [C] overcome [G] wrong;
There’s [C] lifegiving [D7] power in us [G] all.

Chorus:

[G] Would you be free from the [C] voices of [G] doubt?
There’s [D] power in us all, [G] power in us all;
[G] Wisdom will give us the [C] strength to speak [G] out;
There’s [C] lifegiving [D7] power in us [G] all.

Chorus:

[G] When we are working for [C] justice and [G] peace,
there’s [D] power in us all, [G] power in us all;
[G] Wisdom within us will [C] daily in [G] crease;
There’s [C] lifegiving [D7] power in us [G] all.

Chorus:
