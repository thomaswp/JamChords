We Are Rising Up Together
Song #87
McKenzie Brown, Charles H. Gabriel 
(Tune of “Will the Circle Be Unbroken”*)

I was [C] standing with con [C7] victions, 
but a [F] lone from day to [C] day.
And I [C] wondered, were there [Am] others, 
Who could [C] help me [G7] find my [C] way?

Chorus: 	We are [C] rising up to [C7] gether
		In a [F] circle, side by [C] side.
		Let us  [C] learn to, love each [Am] other,
		So it [C] may grow [G7] deep and [C] wide.

Then one [C] day I found my [C7] people, 
For the [F] first time, uncon [C] strained.
We re [C] joiced and started [Am] planning 
How to [C] ease the [G7] world of [C] pain.

Chorus

As we [C] parted, we felt [C7] sadness, 
for we [F] left our newfound [C] home.
But in [C] spirit, our new [Am] fam’ly 
Would now [C] help us [G7] to press [C] on.

Chorus

We face [C] trials, imper [C7] fection, 
there is [F] much now to re [C] sist.
But to [C] gether, we are [Am] steadfast, 
all to [C] gether [G7] we per [C] sist.

Chorus
