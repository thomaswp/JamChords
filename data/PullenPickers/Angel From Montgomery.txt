[C] I am an old [F] woman [C] named after my [F] mother.
[C] My old man is a [F] nother [G] child that's grown [C] old.
[C] If dreams were [F] thunder [C] and lightning was de [F] sire
[C] this old house would've [F] burnt down a [G] long time a [C]  go.

[C] Make me an [C] angel that [F] flies from Mont [C] gomery.
Make me a [C] poster of [F] an old rod e[C] o.
Just give me [C] one thing that [F] I can hold [C] on to.
To believe in this [F] living is just a [G] hard way to [C] go.  [F] [C] [F]

[C] When I was a young [F] pup [C] you had  [F] a cowboy,
[C] wasn't much to [F] look at, [G] just a free rambl-in' [C] man.
But that was a [F] long time, and [C] no matter how [F]  I try,
[C] the years can't go [F] back like a [G] broken down [C] dam.
[C] Make me an [C] angel that [F] flies from  Mont [C] gomery.

Make me a [C] poster of [F] an old rode [C] o.
Just give me [C] one thing that [F] I can hold [C] on to.
To believe in this [F] living is just a [G] hard way to [C] go.  [F] [C] [F]

[C] There's flies [F]  in the [C] kitchen, I can [F] hear all their buzzin'
[C] but I ain't done [F]  nothin' since I [G] woke up  to [C] day.
But how the hell [F] can a person go to [C] work in the [F] morning
[C] come home in the [F] evenin' and have nothin' [G] to say? [C]
[C] Make me an [C] angel that [F] flies from  Mont [C] gomery.

Make me a [C] poster of [F] an old rode [C] o.
Just give me [C] one thing that [F] I can hold [C] on to.
To believe in this [F] living is just a [G] hard way to [C] go.
To believe in this [F] living is just a [G] hard way to [C] go.
