There's a [D] land that is [G] fairer than [D] day,And by [D] faith we can see it a [A7] far;For the [D] Father waits [G] over the [D] wayTo pre [D] pare us a [A7] dwelling place [D] there.

In the [D] sweet by and [A7] by,We shall [A7] meet on that beautiful [D] shore;In the [D] sweet by and [G-A7] by,We shall [D] meet on that [A7] beautiful [D] shore.
We shall sing on that beautiful shoreThe melodious songs of the blessed;And our spirits shall sorrow no more,Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.
Chorus
To our bountiful Father above,We will offer our tribute of praiseFor the glorious gift of His loveAnd the blessings that hallow our days.
