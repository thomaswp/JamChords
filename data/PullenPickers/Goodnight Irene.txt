Chorus:
[G] Irene, good [D7] night. [D7] Irene, good [G] night 
Good [G] night, I [G7] rene. Good [C] night, I [Am] rene. 
I'll [C] see you [D7] in my [G] dreams.

Last Saturday night I got married. 
Me and my wife settled down.
Now, me and my wife are parted. 
Gonna take a little stroll downtown.

Chorus

Yeah, sometimes I live in the country 
And sometimes I live in town.
Yeah, and sometimes I take a great notion
 I'm gonna jump in the river and drown.

Chorus

Stop rambling'. Stop that gambling'. 
Stop staying out late at night.
Go home to your wife and family. 
Stay there by the fireside, bright.

Chorus

Goodnight, Irene. Goodnight, Irene. 
I'll see you in my dreams.
