Tear My Stillhouse Down
Song #18
Gillian Welch 
Gillian Welsh AJ Lee and Blue Summit	
Leader(s):  Noelle (in C)

Put no [C] stone at my head, no [F] flowers on my tomb
No [C] gold-plated sign, in a [G] marble pillared room
The [C] one thing I want, when they [F] lay me in the ground
When I [C] die, [G] tear my stillhouse [C] down
 
CHORUS

Oh, [F] tear my stillhouse down, let it go to rust
Don’t [C] leave no trace of the hiding place where I made that evil stuff
For [F] all my time and money, no profit did I see
That [C] old copper kettle was the [G7] death of [C] me.
 
When [C] I was a child, way [F] back in the hills
I [C] laughed at the men, who [G] tended those stills
But that [C] old mountain shine, it [F] caught me somehow
When I [C] die, [G] tear my stillhouse [C] down.
 
CHORUS

 Oh [C] tell all your children, that [F] Hell ain’t no dream
‘Cause [C] Satan he lives, in my [G] whiskey machine
And [C] in my time of dying, I [F] know where I’m bound
So when I [C] die,… [G] tear my stillhouse [C] down
 
CHORUS
 
That [C] old copper kettle was the [G7] death of [C] me.
