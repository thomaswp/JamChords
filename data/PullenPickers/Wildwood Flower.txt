[G] Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and [D] raven black [G] hair
With the roses so red and the [D] lilies so [G] fair
And the myrtle so bright with the [C] emerald [G]
The pale amanita and [GD] eyes look like [G] blue


[G] will dance, I will sing and my [D] laugh shall be [G] gay
I will charm every heart, in his [D] crown I will [G] sway
When I woke from my dreaming, my [C] idol was [G] clay
All portion of love had [D] all flown a [G] way

 
Oh, he [G] taught me to love him and [D] promised to [G] love
And to [G] cherish me over all [D] others a [G] bove
How my [G] heart is now wondering, no [C] misery can [G] tell
He's [G] left me no warning, no [D] words of fare [G] well

 
Oh, he [G] taught me to love him and [D] called me his [G] flower
That was [G] blooming to cheer him through [D] life's dreary [G] hour
Oh, I [G] long to see him and re [C]  gret the dark [G] hour
He's [G] gone and neglected his [D] pale wildwood [G] flower.
