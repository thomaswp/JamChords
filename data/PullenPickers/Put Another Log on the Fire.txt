Put Another Log on the Fire
Song #95
Shel Silverstein
Tompall Glaser
Leader(s): Larry:  Key of G

[G] Put another log on the fire
Cook me up some bacon and some [D7] beans
And go out to the car and change the tire
Wash my socks and sew my old blue [G] jeans.

[G] (Come on baby) you can fill my pipe and then go fetch my slippers
And boil me up another pot of [C] tea
Then put another log on the [G] fire babe
And [D7] come and tell me why you're leaving [G] me.

[G] Now don't I let you wash the car on Sunday
And don't I warn you when you're getting [D7] fat
Ain't I a gonna take you fishing with me someday
Well a man can't love a woman more than [G] that.

And ain't I always nice to your kid sister
Don't I take her driving every [C] night
So sit here at my feet cause I like you when you're sweet
And you [D7] know it ain't feminine to [G] fight.

[G] Put another log on the fire
Cook me up some bacon and some [D7] beans
And go out to the car lift it up and change the tire
Wash my socks and sew my old blue [G] jeans.

[G] (Come on baby) you can fill my pipe and then go fetch my slippers
And boil me up another pot of [C] tea.
Then put another log on the [G] fire.
And [D7] come and tell me why you're leaving [G] me.
And [D7] come and tell me why you're leaving [G] me.
