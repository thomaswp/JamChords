[C] We had an a [Dm] apartment in the [G] city [G7]
[C] Me and Lo [Dm] retta liked living [G] there [G7]
[Cmaj7] Well it's been years since the [F] kids have grown
A life [C] of their own and left [G] us alone

[C] We had an a [Dm] partment in the [G] city [G7]
[C] Me and Lo [Dm] retta liked living [G] there [G7]
[Cmaj7] Well it's been years since the [F] kids have grown
A life [C] of their own and left [G] us alone
[C] John and [Dm] Linda live in [G] Omaha [G7]
[C] And Joe is some-[Dm] where on the [G] road [G7]
[Cmaj7] We lost Davy in the Ko-[F] rean war
And still don't [C] know what for, it don't matter [G] any more
[Bb] You know that old trees just grow [C] stronger
[Bb] Old rivers grow wilder every [C] day
[Em] Old people just grow [F] lonesome
Waiting for some [C]one to say hel [G]                                                                                                                                                                                                                 lo in there, hel [C] lo
[C] We had an a [Dm] partment in the [G] city [G7]
[C] Me and Lo [Dm] retta liked living [G] there [G7]
[Cmaj7] Well it's been years since the [F] kids have grown
A life [C] of their own and left [G] us alone

[C] Me and Lo [Dm] retta we don't [G] talk much more [G7]
[C] She sits and [Dm] stares through the back door [G] screen [G7]
[Cmaj7] And all the news just re [F] peats itself
Like some for [C] gotten dream that [G] we've both seen
[C] Someday I'll [Dm] go and call up [G] Rudy [G7]
[C] We worked to [Dm] gether at the [G] factory [G7]
[Cmaj7] But what could I say if he [F] asks what's new
Nothing [C] what's with you, nothing [G] much to do
[Bb] You know that old trees just grow [C] stronger
[Bb] Old rivers grow wilder every [C] day
[Em] Old people just grow [F] lonesome
Waiting for some [C]one to say hel [G] lo in there, hel [C] lo
[C] So if you're out [Dm] walking down the [G] street sometime [G7]
[C] And spot some [Dm] hollow ancient [G] eyes [G7]
[Cmaj7] Please don't just pass them [F] by and stare
As if you [C] didn't care say hel [G] lo in there, hel [C] lo.
