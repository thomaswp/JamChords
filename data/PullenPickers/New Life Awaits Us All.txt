We  [G] join with people [G7] rising  [C] up on every [G] shore,
And [G] we keep on em [G7] bracing new [D7] life ever [G] more.


We will not [G] let a [G7] busive [C] systems keep us  [G] down;
they cannot stop us  [G] now, for [A7] we are freedom  [D7] bound.
The  [G] Spirit deep with [G7] in gives [C] energy to [G] soar,
And [G] we keep on em [G7] bracing new [D7] life ever [G] more.


The [G] Spirit gives us [G7] visions of [C] equali [G] ty;
Their [G] power sets us free to [A7] be all we can [D7] be.
We [G] join to [G7] gether, moving [C] onward to ex [G] plore,
And [G] we keep on em [G7] bracing new [D7] life ever [G] more.


We’re [G] growing, [G7] changing, [C] claiming all our [G] gifts;
the Spirit liber [G] ates, em [A7] powers, and up [D7] lifts.
They [G] call us always [G7] forward [G] through the open [G] doors,
And [G] we keep on em [G7] bracing new [D7] life ever [G] more.
