I was [G] standing by my [G7] window, on a [C] cold and cloudy [G] day.
When I [G] saw that hearse come [Em] rolling,
For to [G] carry my [D7] mother [G] away.

Chorus:

Will the [G] circle be un [G7] broken, By and [C] by, Lord, by and [G] by?
There's a [G] better home a [Em] waiting, 
In the [G] sky, Lord, [D7] in the [G] sky.

Lord, I [G] told that under [G7] taker, "Under [C] taker, please drive [G] slow.
For the [G] body you are [Em] hauling, Lord, I [G] hate to [D7] see her [G] go."

Chorus

Lord, I [G] followed close be [G7] hind her, Tried to [C] hold up and be [G] brave.
But I [G] could not hide my [Em] sorrow, When they [G] laid her [D7] in the [G] grave.

Chorus

Went back [G] home, Lord, my home was [G7] lonesome,
Since my [C] mother, she was [G] gone.
All my [G] brothers, sisters [Em] cryin', What a [G] home so [D7] sad and [G] lone.

Chorus

We [G] sang the songs of [G7] childhood, Hymns of [C] Faith that made us [G] strong.
Ones that [G] Mother Maybelle [Em] taught us, 
hear the [G] angels [D7] sing a [G] long.

Chorus
