Leader(s): Noelle (Key of A – Capo up 2 with G Chords)


[G] I am an orphan, on God’s [D] Highway,
But I’ll share my troubles, If you go [C] my way.
I have no [G] mother, no [D] father, no [G] sister, no [C] brother.
[G] I am an or [D] phan [G] girl.

I have had friendships, pure and golden,
But the ties of kinship, I have not known them.
I know no mother, no father, no sister, no brother.
I am an orphan girl.

But when he calls me, I will be able
To meet my family, at God’s table.
I’ll meet my mother, my father, my sister, my brother.
No more orphan girl.

Blessed Savior, make me willing,
And walk beside me, until I am with them.
Be my mother, my father, my sister, my brother.
I am an orphan girl.
