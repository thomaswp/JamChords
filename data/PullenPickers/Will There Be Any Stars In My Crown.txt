Will There Be Any Stars In My Crown
Song #48
E. E. Hewitt 
Alison Krauss

Leader(s): Noell


I am [C] thinking today of that [C] beautiful [Dm] land
I shall [G] reach when the [G7] sun goeth [C] down
When through [C] wonderful grace by my [F] Savior I [Dm] stand
Will there [C] be any stars in my [C] crown?

CHORUS
 
Will there [C] be any stars, any stars in my crown
When at [C] evening the [D7] sun goeth [G] down
When I [C] wake with the blest in those [F] mansions of rest
Will there [C] be any [G] stars in my [C] crown?
 
In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray
Let me watch as a winner of souls
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day
When his praise like the sea billow rolls.
 
CHORUS
 
Oh, what joy it will be when his face I behold
Living gems at his feet to lay down
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold
Should there be any stars in my crown?

CHORUS
