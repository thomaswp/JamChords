(Tune of “Jesus Paid It All”)
Kim Walker-Smith, Joey & Rory, 
Steph McLeod – Celtic Version


Our [D] Loving Shepherd guides our [A7] journey day and [D] night,
And [D] when we lose our way, 
[A7] They [D] know our [A7] fearful [D] plight.

Chorus

[D] Loving Shepherd calls, searching [A] everywhere;
[D] When we’re lost and [G-G7] alone, They [A7] come with tender [D] care.

Our [D] Loving Shepherd goes to [A7] find the missing [D] one,
They [D] comb the wilderness, 
[A7] from [D] dawn to [A7] setting [D] sun.

Chorus

Our [D] Loving Shepherd calls, with [A7] strong and urgent [D] voice;
When at [D] last she finds the lost, 
[A7] They will [D] ever [A7] more re [D] joice.
