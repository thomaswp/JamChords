Leader(s): Jim - Key of C

[C] If I had a hammer, I'd [F] hammer in the [C] morning 
I'd hammer in the [F] evening, all over this [G7] land 
I'd hammer out [C] danger 
I'd hammer out a [Am] warning 
I'd hammer out [F] love be [C] tween my [F] brothers and my [C] sisters 
[F-G7] All over this [C] land. 

If I had a bell, I'd ring it in the morning 
I'd ring it in the evening, all over this land 
I'd ring out danger 
I'd ring out a warning 
I'd ring out love between my brothers and my sisters 
All over this land.

If I had a song, I'd sing it in the morning 
I'd sing it in the evening, all over this land 
I'd sing out danger 
I'd sing out a warning 
I'd sing out love between my brothers and my sisters 
All over this land. 

Well I got a hammer, and I got a bell 
And I got a song to sing, all over this land 
It's the hammer of Justice 
It's the bell of Freedom 
It's the song about Love between My brothers and my sisters 
All over this land. 

It's the hammer of Justice, It's the bell of Freedom 
It's the song about Love between My brothers and my sisters 
All over this land.
