I Still Miss Someone
Song #90
Johnny Cash and Ray Cash, Jr.
The Cluster Pickers
Leader(s): Noelle: Key of G


[G] At my door the [C] leaves are [D7] falling 
The [C] cold wild [D7] wind will [G] come
Sweethearts [C] walk by to [D7] gether
And [C] I still [D7] miss some [G] one
 
I go [C] out on a [D7] party
And [C] look for a [D7] little [G] fun
But I [C] find a darkened [D7] corner
Because [C] I still [D7] miss some [G] one
 
I [C] never got [D7] over those [G] blues eyes
I [C] see them [D7] every [G] where
I [C] miss those [D7] arms that [G] held me
When [C] all the [D7] love was [G] there
 
I [C] wonder if she's [D7] sorry
For [C] leaving what [D7] we'd be [G] gun
There's [C] someone for me [D7] somewhere
And [C] I still [D7] miss some [G] one
