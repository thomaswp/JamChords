By The Mark
Song #20

Leader(s):  Noelle (in C)


[C] When I cross over
I will [G] shout and sing
I will [C] know my savior by the [G] mark
Where the [F] nails have [C] been.

Chorus

By the [C] mark where the nails have been
By the [G] sign upon his precious [C] skin
I will [C] know my savior when I come to him
By the [G] mark where the [C] nails have [C] been.

 A [C] man of riches
May [G] claim a crown of jewels
But the [C] king of heaven
Can be [G] told from the [F] prince of [C] fools.

Chorus

On Calvary Mountain
Where they made him suffer so
All my sin was paid for
A long, long time ago.

 Chorus
