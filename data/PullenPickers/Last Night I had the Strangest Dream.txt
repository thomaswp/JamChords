Last Night I had the Strangest Dream
Song #5
Ed McCurdy 
Simon and Garfunkel
Leader(s):  Jim
  
[C] Last night I had the [C7] strangest dream 
I [F] never dreamed be [C] fore. 
I [G7] dreamed the world had [C] all a [Am] greed 
To [F] put an [G7] end to [C] war.

I [F] dreamed I saw a [C] mighty room 
And the [D7] room filled with women and [C] men
And the [F] papers they were [C] signing [Am] said 
Theyâ€™d [F] never [G7] fight a [C] gain

And when the papers were all signed 
And a million copies made,
They all joined hands and bowed their heads 
And grateful prayers were prayed

And the people in the streets below 
Were dancing 'round and 'round
And guns and swords and uniforms 
Were scattered on the ground.

[C] Last night I had the [C7] strangest dream 
I [F] never dreamed be [C] fore. 
I [G7] dreamed the world had [C] all a [Am] greed 
To [F] put an [G7] end to [C] war.
