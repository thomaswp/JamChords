May God [C] bless and keep you always..
May your [Em] wishes all come true.
May you [Dm] always do for others.
And let [F] others do for [C] you.
May you [C] build a ladder to the stars.
And [Em] climb on every rung, and.
May you stay [F-G] forever [C] young.

Chorus:
Forever [G] young, forever [Am] young.
May you [F-C] stay forever [C] young.

May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true.
May you always know the truth.
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous.
Stand upright and be strong.
May you stay forever young.

Chorus:

May your hands always be busy.
May your feet always be swift.
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift.
May your heart always be joyful.
And may your song always be sung.
May you stay forever young.
