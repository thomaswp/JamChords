All the Good Times (are Passed and Gone)
Song #58
Ralph Stanley
Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs
Leader(s): Mark - Key of A


[G] See that east bound [G] passenger [G] train
Coming around the [E7] bend
It's [G] taking away my [G] own true [G] love
To [G] never re [E7] turn a [G] gain

CHORUS

[G] All the good time are [G] past and [G] gone
All the good times are [E7] o'er
[G] All the good times have [G] past and [G] gone
Little darling [E7] don't you weep no [G] more

I wish dear Lord I'd never been born
Or died when I was young
I never would've seen those two brown eyes
Or heard your lying tongue

CHORUS

See that lonesome turtle dove
Flying from pine to pine
He's mourning for his own true love
Just like I mourn for mine

CHORUS
