CHORUS

[G] It's me, (it's me) it's me, O Lord
Standing in the [D] need of [G] prayer;
It's [G] me, (it's me) it's me, O Lord
[Em] Standing in the [D7] need of [G] prayer;

Not my [G] brother, not my sister but it's [D7] me O [G] Lord
Standing in the [D] need of [G] prayer
Not my [G] brother, not my sister but it's [D7] me O [G] Lord
Standing in the [D] need of [G] prayer

CHORUS
 
Not the elder, not the deacon but it's me O Lord…

Not my father, not my mother but it's me O Lord…

Not the stranger, not my neighbor, but it's me O Lord…
