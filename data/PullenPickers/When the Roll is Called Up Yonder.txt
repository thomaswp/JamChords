When the Roll is Called Up Yonder
Song #47
Traditional 
Dolly Parton Alison Kraus Suzanne Cox
Leader(s): Noell

When the [G] trumpet of the Lord shall sound, 
and [C] time shall be no [G] more,
And the [G] morning breaks, et [G] ernal, bright and [D7] fair.
When the [G] saved of earth shall [G7] gather over [C] on the other [G] shore,
And the [G] roll is called up [D7] yonder, I’ll be [G] there.

CHORUS 

When the [G] roll, is called up yonder,
When the [D7] roll, is called up yonder,
When the [G] roll, is [G] called up [G] yonder,
When the [G] roll is called up [D7] yonder I’ll be [G] there.

 
On that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in Christ shall rise,
And the glory of His resurrection share.
When His chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.

CHORUS 

Let us labor for the Master from the dawn till setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care;.
Then when all of life is over, and our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder, I’ll be there.
