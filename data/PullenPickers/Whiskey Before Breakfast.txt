Whiskey Before Breakfast
Song #44
Benjy Griffith 
Bobby Hicks, Norman Blake
Leader(s): Thomas in D


Well, [D] early one morning ‘fore the sun could shine
I was [G] walkin’ down the [D] street not [G] feelin’ so fine
I [D] saw two old men with a bottle between ‘em
And [G] this is the [D] song that I [G] heard them [D] singin’
 
Chorus

[D] Lord, preserve us. Saints, protect us.
[G] We been drinkin’ whiskey ‘fore breakfast. [D][G][G][G][G][D][G][D]

Well, I passed by the steps where they were a’sittin’
I couldn’t believe how drunk they were gettin’
I said, “Old men, have you been drinkin’ long?”
They said, “Just long enough to be singin’ this song.”
 
Chorus

Well, they handed me a bottle, said, "Take a little sip."
And it felt so good, I just couldn't quit
So I took a little more, next thing I knew
There were three of us sittin' there singin' this tune

Chorus

Well, one by one everybody in town
Heard our ruckus and they all came down
Pretty soon all the streets were a-ringin’
With the sound of the whole town laughin’ and singin’

Chorus (2 Times)
