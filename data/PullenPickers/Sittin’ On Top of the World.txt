[C] Was in the spring one sunny [C7] dayMy sweetheart [F] left me Lord she went a [C] way.And now she's gone and I don't' [G7] worry.[C] Lord I'm sitting on [G7] top of the [C] world.She called me up from down in El PasoShe said come back daddy ooh I need you soAnd now she's gone and I don't' worryLord I'm sitting on top of the worldIf you don't like my peaches don't you shake my treeThen get out of my orchard let my peaches beAnd now she's gone and I don't' worryLord I'm sitting on top of the world
And don't you come here runnin' holding out your handI'm gonna get me a woman like you got your manAnd now she's gone and I don't' worryLord I'm sitting on top of the worldIt was in the spring one sunny dayMy sweetheart left me Lord she went away And now she's gone and I don't' worryLord I'm sitting on top of the world
