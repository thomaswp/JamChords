Leader(s): Dane, Thomas [Eb Capo up 4]

'Twas in the [G] Spring one sunny day, My good girl [C] left me, she went [G] away,
Now she's gone, but I don't [Em] worry,
'cause I'm [G] sittin' on [D] top of the [G] world.

She called me [G] from Durham and Carrboro 
Said, "Come on [C] honey, I'm all [G] alone."
Now she's gone, but I don't [Em] worry,
'cause I'm [G] sittin' on [D] top of the [G] world.

Cape Fear [G] River, long deep and wide, I got me a  [C] woman on the other [G] side.
And now she's gone, and I don't [Em] worry,
'cause I'm [G] sittin' on [D] top of the [G] world

You don't like my [G]  peaches, don't you shake my tree,
Get out of my [C] orchard, let my peaches [G] be.
And now she's gone, and I don't [Em] worry,
'cause I'm [G] sittin' on [D] top of the [G] world.

Ashes to [G] ashes and dust to dust,
If the women don't  [C] get you then  the liquor [G] must.
And now she's gone, and I don't [Em] worry,
'cause I'm [G] sittin' on [D] top of the [G] world

And don't [G] come here running, holding out your hand
I'm gonna get me a [C] woman, like you got your [G] man.
And now she's gone, and I don't [Em] worry,
'cause I'm [G] sittin' on [D] top of the [G] world.

'Twas in the [G]  Spring one sunny day,
My sweetheart [C] left me. Lord, she went a-[G] way,
And now she's gone, and I don't [Em] worry,
[Em] 'cause  I'm [G] sittin' on [D] top of the [G] world.
[Em] 'Cause  I'm [G] sittin' on [D] top of the [G] world.
