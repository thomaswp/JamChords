Far Side of the Jordan
Song #35
Terry Smith 
Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash
Leader(s):

[F] I believe my steps are growing [C] wearier each day,
Still I've got another journey on my [F] mind.
Lures of this old world have ceased to [C]  make me wanna stay
And my one regret is leaving you be [F]  hind.

[F] But if it proves to be his will that I [C]  am first to cross
And somehow  I'll be feeling  it will [F]  be
When it comes your time to travel [C]  likewise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll [F]  see.

Chorus

[F] And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be [Bb] sitting drawing pictures in the [F] sand
And [C] when I see you coming I will [F] rise up with a shout
And come [Bb] running through the [F] shallow water [C] reaching for your [F]  hand.

Through this life we've labored hard to earn our meager fare.
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes.
(June) So I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come then we'll see paradise.
