Song #71
Floyd Jenkins
Gillian Welch
Leader(s): Dane - Key of C 

There was a [Am] Camptown [Em7] man who used to [F] plow and [C] sing.
[Am] He loved that [Em7] mule and the [F] mule loved [Am] him.
When the [Am] day got [Am] long as it [F] does about [C] now,
[Am] I'd hear him [Em7] singing to his [F] muley [C] cow. 

Calling [Am] come on my [Em7] sweet old [C] girl [Csus4]      
[C] I’d bet the [C] whole damn [Am] world [Csus4]    
[C] We’re gonna [F] make it [C] yet to the [Am] end of the [G7] row.  [G7] [Gsus4] [G] 

CHORUS
Singing [Am] hard times [Em7] ain’t gonna [F] rule my mind [C]
[Am] Hard times [Em7] ain’t gonna [F] rule my mind [C], Bessie
[Am] Hard times [Em7] ain’t gonna [F] rule my mind [G7] no [C] more  [C]  

He said it's a [Am] big old [Em7]  world, [F] heavy in [C] need
[Am] That big ma [Em7] chine is just a [F] picking up [C] speed
We're [Am] supping on [Em7] tears and we're [F] supping on [C] wine
[Am] But we all get to [Em7] heaven in our [F] own sweet [C] time  [Csus4]     

[C] So come on you [C] Asheville [C] boys,  [C] Turn up your [C] old time [C] noise          
[C] Kick till the [F] dust comes [C] up from the [Am] cracks in the [G7] floor. [Gsus4] [G]       

CHORUS

But the [Am] Camptown [Em7] man he doesn't [F] plow no [C] more
[Am] I seen him [Em7] walking down to the [F] superette [C] store
Guess he [Am] lost that [Em7] nag and he for [F] got that [C] song
[Am] Woke up one [Em7]  morning and the [F] mule was [C] gone. [C]  

So [C] come all ye [C] ragtime [C] kings, [C] Come on you [C] dogs that [C] sing  [Csus4]          
[C] Pick up your [F] dusty old [C] horn and Am give it a [G7] blow. [G7]  [Gsus4]  [G]       

Singing [Am] hard times [Em7] ain’t gonna [F] rule my [C] mind
[Am] Hard times [Em7]  ain’t gonna [F] rule my [C] mind, sugar,
[Am] Hard times [Em7] ain’t gonna [F] rule’ my [G7]  mind  [G7]  
No [C] more. [C]
