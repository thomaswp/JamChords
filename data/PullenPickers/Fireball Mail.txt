Leader(s): Dane - Key of C 

[C] Here she comes look at her roll
There she goes eating that [G7] coal
Watch her [C] fly huggin’ the rail
Let her by by [G7] it's the fireball [C] mail
 
Instrumental Break
           
[C] Let her go look at her steam
Hear her blow [G7] whistle and scream
Like a [C] hound wagging his tail
Dallas bound bound [G7] bound the fireball [C] mail

Instrumental Break
          
Engineer making up time
Tracks are clear look at her climb
See that freight clearing the rail
Bet she's late late late the fireball mail

Instrumental Break
           
Watch her swerve look at her sway
Get that curve out of the way
Watch her fly look at her sail
Let her by by by the fireball mail
