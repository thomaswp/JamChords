Train Song
Song #38
Mandolin Orange
Mandolin Orange
Leader(s): Dane

[G] I never did have that fast train to [C] take me down the [G] line
Or [D] smelled the smoke from a hot coal as the [G] engine [G7] fired
If I [C] could ask that engineer for [G] one more [F#] mile and then I’ll [Em] go
Just let the [C] whistle wail and [D] take it in [G] slow
[G] Take me back to the railroad track [C] and the sounds in[G] side my mind
Where [D] rusty wheels and steel rails still [G-G7] whine
[C] Where I can hop that 989 and go [G] back in [F#] time some time ago [Em]
Just let the [C] whistle wail and [D] take it in [G] slow

Park my horse and buggy by some old lazy creek
Take my car to the graveyard and dig a hole real deep

We’ll holler “rest in peace” and weep, lay track on every street
Let the whistle wail and give the rail my soul to keep
Mr. engineer just one more mile and then I’ll go
Just let the whistle wail and take it in slow
Let the whistle wail and take it in slow
