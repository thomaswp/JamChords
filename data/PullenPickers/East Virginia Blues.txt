East Virginia Blues
Song #94
Traditional
Earl Scruggs and Bob Dylan
Leader(s): Larry:  Key of D

I was [D] born in [G] East Vir [D] ginia,
North Caro [G] lina I did [D] go.
There I [G] met a fair young [D] maiden,
Her name and [A] age I did not[D]  know.

Oh, her hair was dark and curly,
And her cheeks were rosy red.
On her breast she wore white linen,
Where I longed to lay my head.

I don't want your green back dollar,
I don't want your watch and chain.
All I want is your heart darling,
Say you'll take me back again.

The ocean's deep and I can't wade it,
And I have no wings to fly.
I'll just get me a blue eyed boaten,
For to row me over time.

I'll go back to East Virginia,
North Carolina ain't my home.
I'll go back to East Virginia,
Leave them North Carolinians alone.
