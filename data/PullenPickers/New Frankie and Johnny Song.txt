[G7] Frankie, [G7] she was a [C] fine-lookin' woman, had a [C7] man named Johnny
And she [G7] loved him, [G7], she [C] bought him a car and a [D7] suit of clothes,
Can't you [G7] see them [G7] [C] walkin' arm-in-arm down the [C7] long Canal Street?
 [G7] Frankie loved [G7] Johnny, [C] Lord, every [D7] body [G7] knows.

Now, Frankie, she came home one evening just a little bit early,
And she thought, I’ll go down to the corner for a bottle of beer.
So, she sat there, and she told her troubles to the fat bartender,
Said, "Hey, Fat Daddy, has my Lovin’ Johnny man been here?"

He said, "Frankie," now "I’m awful sorry you asked me that question,
You know, I’m 'bout as honest as a man can be.
Well, i saw him, he was walkin' down main and a-feelin' no pain,
Just a-slippin' and a-slidin' with a girl named Annabel Lee."

So, Frankie, she said, "oh, no, no, it can't be so,
I know, i know my lovin’ Johnny wouldn't treat me bad!"
And she sat there, she had a few more beers, shed a few more tears,
Said, "I’m the best woman that scoundrel ever had!"

So, Frankie, she got into a taxi and she said to the driver,
“Listen, don’t you stop for nothin’ on the way downtown
I got, I got a 45 here and I’m makin’ it clear,
I’m lookin’ for the man who’s givin’ me the runaround.”

So, Frankie, she got out at West Park and she looked in the window, and
She saw, she saw Johnny and Annabel swingin’ there.
So Frankie, she took deadly aim on her deadly game, and 
She shot her man in the middle of his big affair.

So, Children, that’s the story ‘bout Frankie and the man named Johnny, and
You know, that sort of game shoulda never been played,
So the moral, of this sad tale I’m a-tellin’ you,
If you’re gonna fool around, you better pull the shades!
If you’re gonna fool around … You better pull the shades!
