Christmas in Prison
Song #23
John Prine 
John Prine
Leader(s):  Grace

It was [G] Christmas in prison and the [C] food was real good.
We had [G] turkey and pistols carved out of  [D7] wood.
And I [G] dream of her always even [C] when I don't dream,
Her [G] name's on my tongue and her [D] blood's in my [G] stream.

Chorus:

 [D] Wait awhile e [C] terni [G] ty.
 [C] Old Mother Nature's got [G] nothing on [D] me.
 [G] Come to me, run to me, [C] come to me now.
We're [G] rolling my sweetheart, we're [D] flowing by [G] God.

She re [G] minds me of a chess game with [C] someone I admire,
Or a [G] picnic in the rain after a prairie [D7] fire.
Her [G] heart is a big as this [C] whole damn jail.
And she's [G] sweeter than saccharine at a [D] drug store  [G] sale.

Chorus 

The [G] search light in the big yard swings [C] 'round with the gun.
And [G] spotlights the snowflakes like the dust in the  [D7] sun.
It's [G] Christmas in prison, there'll be [C] music tonight.
I'll [G] probably get homesick I [D] love you, good [G] night.

Chorus
