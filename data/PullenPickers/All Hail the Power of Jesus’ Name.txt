Leader(s): Miranda - Key of G

All [G] hail the pow'r of [D] Jesus' name! 
[C] Let [G] angels [D] prostrate [G] fall.
Bring [G] forth the royal diadem, 
and crown [Em] him [G]  Lord of [D] all.
Bring [G] forth the royal [G] diadem, 
and crown [Em] him [G] Lo [D] rd of [D] all.

O chosen seed of Israel's race
now ransomed from the fall,
hail him who saves you by his grace, 
and crown him Lord of all.
hail him who saves you by his grace, 
and crown him Lord of all.

Let every tongue and every tribe
responsive to his call,
to him all majesty ascribe,
and crown him Lord of all.
to him all majesty ascribe,
and crown him Lord of all.

Oh, that with all the sacred throng
we at his feet may fall!
We'll join the everlasting song. 
and crown him Lord of all.
We'll join the everlasting song. 
and crown him Lord of all.
