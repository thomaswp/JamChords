I’ll Fly Away
Song #13
Albert E. Brumley 
Alison Krauss and Gillian Welsh
Leader(s): 

[G] Some bright morning [G7] when this life is over
[C] I’ll fly a [G] way
[G] To a home on God's celestial shore,
I' [D7] I’ll  fly  a [G] way
 
Chorus

[G] I’ll fly away oh glory
[C] I’ll fly a [G] way, in the morning
[G] When I die hallelujah, by and by
[G] I’[D7] ll fly a [G] way 

[G] When the shadows [G7] of this life have gone
[C] I’ll fly a [G] way
[G] Like a bird from these prison walls I’ll fly
[G] I’[D7] ll fly a [G] way

Chorus

[G] Oh how glad and [G7] happy when we meet
[C] I’ll fly a [G] way
[G] No more cold iron shackles on my feet
[C] I’ll fly a [G] way

Chorus

[G] Just a few more [G7] weary days and then
[C] I’ll fly a [G] way
[G] To a land where joys will never end
[C] I’ll fly a [G] way

Chorus
