Darlinâ€™ Corey
Song #41
Traditional 
Ricky Scaggs and Bruce Hornsby
Leader(s): Thomas in G

[Am] Wake up, wake up darlin' [G] Corey. 
[Am] What makes you [Em] sleep so [Am] sound.
The [Am] revenue officers are [G] comin',
Gonna [Am] tear your [Em] still house [Am] down.

Chorus
Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow. 
Dig a hole in the cold, cold ground.
Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow. 
Gonna lay darlin Corey down.

Oh the first time I saw darlin' Corey 
She was standin' in the door.
Her shoes and her stockings in her hand. 
Little bare feet on the floor.

Oh the next time I saw darlin' Corey
She was standin' by the banks of the sea. 
She had a .44 strapped on her body,
And a banjo on her knee.

Oh the last time I saw darlin' Corey 
She had a wine glass in her hand. 
She was drinkin' that sweet liquor 
With a low down gamblin' man.

Can't you hear those bluebirds singin'? 
Don't you hear that mournful sound? 
They're preachin' darlin' Corey's funeral 
In some lonesome graveyard ground.

Chorus
