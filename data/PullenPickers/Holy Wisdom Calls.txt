[G] When will oppression and [C] violence [G] cease?
[G] When will we see Wisdom’s truth [A] in [D7] crease?
[G] They are the path to a [C] world of [G] peace,
[G] Holy [D7] Wisdom [G] Calls.

CHORUS:

[C] Holy Wisdom [G] Calls; [G] Holy Wisdom [A-D7] Calls;
[G] They are the path to a [C] world of [G] peace;
[G] Holy [D7] Wisdom [G] Calls

[G] How long will hatred and [C] fear hold [G] sway?
[G] When will we all follow [A] Wisdom’s [D7] way?
[G] They guide us forward to [C] peaceful [G] days.
[G] Holy [D7] Wisdom [G] Calls

CHORUS

[G] Come join with Wisdom to [C] end the [G] strife;
[G] Follow Her pathways for [A] all to [D7] thrive.
[G] They lead us on to a [G] bundant life.
[G] Holy [D7] Wisdom [G] calls.

CHORUS


*My mother, who died at age100 in 2006, never missed a Jimmy Swaggert telecast, but insisted (to me at least) that she only watched for the music … (he is, after all Jerry Lee Lewis’ cousin)
