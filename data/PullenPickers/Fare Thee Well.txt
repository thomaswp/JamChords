Fare Thee Well
Song #52
Oscar Isaac: From Inside Llewyn Davis  
Oscar Isaac in Inside Llewyn Davis
Leader(s): Judy

If I had [G] Wings, like [C] Noah's [G] Dove
I'd fly up the [Em] river, to the [D] one I [C] love
Fare the [G] well, [C] my [G] honey, [D] fare thee [G] well.

Well I had a man, who was long and tall
Moved his body like a cannonball
Fare the well, my honey, Fare thee well

I remember one evening, in the pouring rain
In my heart was an aching pain
Fare the well, my honey, fare thee well.

Instrumental

Muddy river is muddy and wild
Can't give a bloody for my unborn child
Fare the well, my honey, fare the well.

Show us a bird, flying high above
Life ain't worth living without the one you love
Fare the well, my honey, fare thee well.

Fare the well, my honey, fare thee well.
