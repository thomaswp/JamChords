Steel Rails
Song #65
Allison Kraus
Allison Krauss and Union Station
Leader(s): Noelle and Miranda - Key of C

CHORUS

It's not the first time, I [Dm] found myself alone at dawn
[F] If I really had you [G] once, then I’d [F] have you when I'm [C] gone
Whistle blowing, blowing [Dm] lonesome in my mind
[C] Calling me al [G] ong that never [F] ending metal [C] line

 CHORUS

INSTRUMENTAL BREAK
 
Sun is shining through the [Dm] open box car door
[F] Calling me a [G] way to the [F] things I’ve known [C] before
I've lost count of the [Dm} hours days and times
[F] Just the rhythm of the [G] rails keeps the [F] motion in my [C] mind

CHORUS
