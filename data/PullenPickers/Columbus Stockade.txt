Columbus Stockade
Song #53
Tom Darby and Jimmie Tarlton.  
Doc and Richard Watson
Leader(s): Thomas: Key of Em


CHORUS

[Em] Way down in Columbus, Georgia
Wanna be [D] back in Tennes [Em] see
Way [Em] down in Columbus Stockade
My friends all [D] turned their backs on [Em] me

CHORUS

Well you can [C] go and leave me if you [Dm] wish to
[C] Never let me cross your [D] mind 
For in your [Em] heart you love another
[D] Leave me little darling, I don’t [Em] mind.

Last night as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, I was mistaken
I was lookin’ through the prison bars

CHORUS

Many a night with you I’ve rambled
Many an hour with you I’ve spent
Thought I had your heart forever
Now I find it was only lent.

CHORUS 
Lord’ I’ve got the walkin’ blues.
