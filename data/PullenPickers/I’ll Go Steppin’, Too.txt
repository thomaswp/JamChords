I’ll Go Steppin’, Too
Song #74
Jerry Organ and Tommy James
Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs
Emmylou Harris and Tom T. Hall
Key of G

[G] Don't think that I'll be hanging around, while you're having [D7] fun,
I won't sit there crying over [G] you.
Well from [G] now on when you’re steppin’ out, I'll tell you what I'll [D7] do. 
 I'll [D7] lock the door put out the cat And I'll go stepping [G] too. 
 
CHORUS:
Yes [G] I'll go stepping too my honey, I'll go stepping [D7] too.
I'll [D7] lock the door put out the cat, and I'll go stepping [G] too.

 Now every time you come in late, and we begin to fight. 
You tell me there are more fish in the sea. 
But the bait ain't what it used to be, and I got news for you. 
Now after this when you go out, well I'll go stepping too. 
 
CHORUS:
 
From now on when you come in and won't tell where you been, 
With your hair messed up and your clothes don't fit you right 
Well I don't care if I find Perfume on you too 
Well you will know that I have been stepping just like you. 
 
CHORUS:
