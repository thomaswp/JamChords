Leader(s):  

Chorus

[G] This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.
[C] This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it [G] shine.
This little light of mine, [B] I'm gonna let it [Em] shine.
Every [G] day, every [C] day, every [G] day, every [Em] way,
Gonna [C] let my [D7] little light [G] shine.

[G] Light that shines is the light of love,
[C] Hides the darkness from above,
[G] Shines on me and it shines on you,
[G] Shows you what the power of [D] love can do.
[G] Shine my light both bright and clear,
[C] Shine my light both far and near,
[G] In every dark corner [Em] that I find,
[G] let my [D] little light [G] shine.

Chorus

[G] Monday gave me the gift of love,
[C] Tuesday peace came from above,
[G] Wednesday told me to have more faith,
[G] Thursday gave me a little more grace,
[G] Friday told me to watch and pray,
Saturday told me just [C] what to say,
[G] Sunday gave me the [Em] power divine
Gonna [G] let my [D] little light [G] shine.
