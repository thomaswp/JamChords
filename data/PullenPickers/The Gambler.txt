Leader(s): Jim:  Key of G

[G] On a warm summer's evening on a [C] train bound for [G] nowhere,
I [G] met up with the gambler, we were both too tired to [D7] sleep.
So [G] we took turns a staring out the [C] window at the [G] darkness,
Till [C] boredom over [G] took us, and he be [D7] gan to [G] speak.
 
He said “[G] Son, I've made a life out of [C] reading people's [G] faces
And [G] knowing [C] what their [G] cards were by the way they held their [D7] eyes
And if [G] you don't mind my saying I can [C] see you're out of [G] aces
For a taste [C] of your [G] whiskey I'll [D7] give you some ad [G] vice.
 
So I [G] handed him my bottle and he [C] drank down my last [G] swallow.
Then he [C] bummed a [G] cigarette and asked me for a [D7] light
And the [G] night got [C] deathly [G] quiet and his [C] face lost all ex [G] pression
Said if you're [G] gonna [C] play the [G] game boy, ya gotta [D7] learn to play it [G] right. 

CHORUS
You got to [G] know when to hold 'em  [C] know when to [G] fold 'em.
[C] know when to [G] walk away and know when to [D7] run
You never[G]  count [C] your [G] money when you're [C] sittin’ at the [G] table
There'll be [G] time e [C] nough for [G] counting, [D7] when the dealin’s [G] done.
 
[G] Every [C] gambler [G] knows that the [C] secret to sur [G] vivin’
Is [G] knowing [C] what to [G] throw away and knowing what to [G] keep.
‘Cause [G] every [C] hand's a [G] winner, and [C] every hand's a [G] loser,
And the [G] best that [C] you can [G] hope for is to [D7] die in your [G] sleep.
 
And [G] when he'd [C] finished [G] speaking he [C] turned back towards the [G] window,
[G] Crushed [C] out his [G] cigarette and faded off to [D7] sleep.
And [G] somewhere [C] in the [G] darkness the [C] gambler he broke [G] even.
But [G] in his [C] final [G] words I found an [D7] ace that I could [G] keep.
