Country Poor and Country Proud
Song #36
Bluegrass Cardinals 
Bluegrass Brothers
Leader(s):

[D] Mama sits and cries a lot lately.
[D] Papa he don’t say much any [G] more.
[G] Times are bad since they just closed the mill down.
I [G] guess we’re getting’ used to bein’ [D] poor.

There’s fresh, hot coffee in the kitchen.
And those biscuits and gravy sure smells [G] good.
There [Em] ain’t no picture pretty as the [G] sunshine,
When you’re [G] looking out the window at the [D] roof.

CHORUS

We might be [D] poor, but we’s [D] proud.
And we’re [D] living the best way we know [G] how.
We don’t [Em] have much, but we don’t look for [G] pity.
‘Cause [G] we’re country [D] poor and country [D] proud.

A stranger came out here from the city.
Came and tried to take some hard luck photographs.
I loaded up my shotgun and I warned him.
“Hey, Mister, we don’t need no help like that.”

I still live in the house I was born in.
It ain’t much but this ol’ farm will get us by.
All I need is a shade tree by my front porch
And have me a tombstone when I die.

CHORUS

CHORUS
…‘Cause We’re country poor and country proud.
