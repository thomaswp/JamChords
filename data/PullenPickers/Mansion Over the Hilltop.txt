Mansion Over the Hilltop
Song #93
Ira Stanphill
Jimmie Davis (1951)
Leader(s): Mark: Key of C 

[C] I'm satisfied with [F] just a cottage be [C] low ;
A little [G7] silver, and a little [C] gold. 
But in that [C] city, where the [F] ransomed will [C] shine; 
I want a [G] gold one, that's silver [C] lined 

CHORUS
I've got a [F] mansion just over the [G] hilltop 
In that bright [G] land where we'll never grow [C] old 
And someday [F] yonder, we'll never more [C] wander 
But walk on [G7] streets that are purest [C] gold 

Though often tempted, tormented and tempted 
And like the prophet, my pillow a stone 
And though I find here, no permanent dwelling 
I know he'll give me a mansion my own 

CHORUS
Don't think me poor or, deserted or lonely 
I'm not discouraged, I'm heaven bound 
I'm just a pilgrim in search of that city.
I want a mansion, a harp, and a crown. 

CHORUS
