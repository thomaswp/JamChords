Canticle of the Turning
Song #22
Rory Cooney Richard Lugar Funeral
Leader(s):  Grace

My [Em] soul cries out with a [C] joyful [D] shout, 
That the [Em] God of my [C] heart is [D] great.And my [Em] spirit sings of the [G] wondrous [D] things 
That you [Em] bring to the [C] ones who [Em] wait.You [G] fixed your sight on your [D] servant's plight 
And my [Em] weakness you [Em] did not [Em] spurn.So from [Em] east to west shall my [G] name be [D] blest 
Could the [Em] world be a [C] bout to [Em] turn?

CHORUS	My [G] heart shall sing of the [D] day you bring. 
Let the [Em] fires of your [C]  justice [D] burn.Wipe a [Em] way all tears for the [C] dawn draws [D] near, 
And the [Em] world is a [C] bout to [Em] turn!

Though I am small, my God, my all, you work great things in me.And your mercy will last from the depths of the past to the end of the age to be.Your very name puts the proud to shame and to those who would for you yearn.You will show your might, put the strong to flight, for the world is about to turn.
CHORUS
From the halls of power to the fortress tower, not a stone will be left on stone.Let the king beware for your justice tears ev'ry tyrant from his throne.The hungry poor shall weep no more for the food they can never earn.There are tables spread, ev'ry mouth be fed, for the world is about to turn. 
CHORUS
Though the nations rage from age to age we remember who holds us fast.God's mercy must deliver us from the conqueror's crushing grasp.This saving word that our forebears heard is the promise which holds us bound.'Til the spear and rod can be crushed by God, who is turning the world around.
CHORUS (2 Times)
