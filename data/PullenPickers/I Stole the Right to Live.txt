I Stole the Right to Live
Song #63
Michael Hurley
Michael Hurley
Leader(s): Jim Key of D

[D] I stole the right to live, as [G] if there was no [D] time.
[D] I stole the eyes of God, as if those eyes were [G] mine.
[D] I took and did infuse, a [G] light that was to [D] shine.

Chorus

[Bm] Oh, [G] mercy. [Bm] Lord, have [G] pity.
I'm only [G] traveling, I don't [G] have no place to [D] go.

I walked the streets of gold and heard the silver tongue.
I passed out on Satanâ€™s hill, and my bed on stone.
Forsaken hearts I wondered, I left them alone.

Harmonica:  Bm - A - Bm - G - A - G - D
D - G - D
D - G - D

A long ways goin' out and have no destiny.
A long ways to believe, dreams that come to be.
I swear they're true a-bloomin', here before me.

Chorus
