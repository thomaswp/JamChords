The Mornin’ Train
Song #88
Lynda Dawson
Kickin’ Grass
Leader(s): Noelle - Key of C 
Chorus:

[C] The Morning Train will carry me home
It’ll bring me [F] back where I be [C] long
And take my [F] soul to heaven’s [C] shore
Where I will [G] see my lord once [C] more.

[C] The morning train, it makes me weep
For a life of [F] sin so long and [C] deep
Though I’m a [F] lone and surely [C] lost
I’ll keep my [G] eyes upon the [C] cross.

Chorus:

[C] The morning train it comes each day
To carry my [F] fears and sins a [C] way
And all the [F] nights can be so [C] long
Come morning [G] time my sins are [C] gone.

Chorus:

[C] The morning train it calms my soul
I know I'm [F] safe when the whistle [C] blows
It carries [F] far it carries [C] wide
And brings my [G] prayers to him on [C] high.

 Chorus:
